# Bare Development Theme

A starting point for WordPress development projects.

Setting up the Bare WP Theme in CodeKit - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjcw-pJLB3E

## CodeKit
I use CodeKit to handle all of my tasks as I work. It compiles my Sass, concatonates and minifies my javascript, and a whole bunch of other stuff. I have included my config.codekit3 in this repo so it can be as easy as dragging the project folder into CodeKit and then you are up and running. If you don't have CodeKit you can purchase it here https://codekitapp.com/

## Sass
This starter bundle uses Sass as a CSS preprocessor. I like my Sass handled a specific way and that is setup in the config.codekit3 file, but obviously you can set it up however you want.

#### Just looking for good ol' HTML?
You can find just the HTML counterpart at https://github.com/rjmccollam/Bare-HTML. Since most of the work I do is WordPress related the HTML version is not always up to date with changes that I have made here.
